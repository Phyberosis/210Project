sorry: it's not as clean as I would like but hey, it plays tetris

Started out trying to get a neural net to play tetris, which would need a trainer. Couldn't get math right for 3 layers deep, but the trainer became more interesting anyways...

screen capture coordinates will likely need to be changed in ScreenToInput -> use "capture" in input box to see what it sees
start script with "begin" in input box

descision making done in TrainerTetris class
